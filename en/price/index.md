# Price

#### The base price to participate is €20.00 for the full weekend.

### The deadline for signing up for site food and beds has passed, sorry.

#### Food

Those who signed up in time will get **food** Friday evening, Saturday
morning/midday/evening, and Sunday morning/midday for an extra
€20.00. If you make your own food, be warned that there may be
limits on the use of open fire if the area is dry.

#### Lodging

All the available **bunk beds** have been reserved. The site provides pilows and covers, but not bedsheets. If you can't bring your own bedsheets, they have a few available for rent at €3 per night. Do not use sleeping bags in the beds.

There is also plenty of space available to put up **tents** - we may be able to arrange spare tents for visitors from far away.

#### Saturday-only participation
If you just want to join us for **the main battles Saturday**, that is possible for €10.00, no food included.

#### Transport
**Transportation to and from Munich** will be done as ride-sharing.

#### Fighting equipment
If you can't bring your own **Belegarth-legal fighting equipment**, weapons and
some shields will be available for use, against a deposit. This
equipment will also be available to buy at the end of the event,
should you want to continue fighting in your home area. Most LARP
weapons are *not* Belegarth-legal.
