# Price

**The base price to participate is €20.00 for the full weekend.**

**Food** (Friday evening, Saturday morning/midday/evening, and Sunday morning/midday) is available for an extra €20.00.

There is a limited number of **bunk beds** available on a first-come first-serve basis, at an extra €15.00 for the weekend. If demand is high, a few extra beds can be put on the floor. There is also plenty of space available to put up **tents** - we may be able to arrange spare tents for visitors from far away.

If you only want to participate Saturday, you can do that for €10.00, or €20.00 if you want food as well.

Transport to and from Munich is still being sorted out, but will likely cost €20.00 total.
