# What is Belegarth?

Belegarth is a medieval reenactment battle game, focusing on speed and intensity in real battles. Our focus on safety allows
full-speed, full-contact fighting, the closest you will get to the intensity of being on a medieval battle field. It is open 
to all adults above 18, regardless of skills or previous experience. There are no fixed styles or moves, but plenty to learn.

## The three pillars of Belegarth

### Safe
We pad the weapons, not the people. The weapons are not steel, not latex, but 5 cm of closed-cell foam over a
fiberglass rod. You can hit people full force with these and leave no more than a bruise at the very worst. This
means anyone can come in, borrow a sword, start fighting, and never hold back!

### Playable
The rules are made to work in large battles where you can't stop all the time to figure out what has happened. No levels,
no magic, no classes, just you and your skills. One hit on your body, you're dead. Lose two limbs, you're dead.
Armor absorbs one hit in each area, where it covers. Rules so simple, you can remember them even when the enemy
turns against your flanking manoeuvre and bears down on you.

### Realistic
Wearing realistic garb, armor, and insignia gives the sport a special feel. While not required, it is highly encouraged
to dress the part, whether as a proud Roman, a frothing Viking, or even an Elf out of Middle-Earth. The choice is yours,
as long as it doesn't interfere with safety and playability. But even the fanciest garb does not impart special abilities
- good fighting skill is learned, not bought.

## The rules of Belegarth

This is a simplfied overview of the rules. The full rule set can be found at belegarth.com.

### Target Areas and hits
	
Head: Do not hit. NO effect
Torso: Hit will kill. 
Arms & Legs: First hit disables the limb - disabled arms go behind the back, with a disabled leg you kneel down on the ground.
Second hit on a limb will kill.
Hand & Feet: No effect for hands holding something or feet on the ground, otherwise counts as arm or leg.

### Armor

Armor protects a certain area of the body against ONE hit. 
e.g.: A person wearing a chain mail or leather mail on its torso will not die when hit. 
However a second hit on the torso, regardless of the exact area will kill him.

### Special weapons 

Apart from regular one-handed weapons, some are color-coded to indicate their differences:

Two-handed weapons (red): A hit with a two-handed weapon ignores the Armor and counts as a hit to the body part. 
Two hard blows with a two-handed weapon on a shield will destroy the shield.

### Arrows

Arrows ignore armor. Arrows may hit the head, which counts as a kill unless the arrow hits a helmeted part. 
Arrows can only be blocked by shields.

### Stabbing (green)

Spears and other weapons with an appropriate padding can be used to stab. A single-handed stab cannot go through armor.
A two-handed stab ignores armor.

### Javelins (yellow)

Javelins are throwing-only weapons that, like arrows, can hit in the head and ignore armor, but unlike arrows they can be
deflected by weapons or grabbed in flight.
